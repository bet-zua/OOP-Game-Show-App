# OOP-Game-Show-App
A browser-based, word guessing game: "Guess the Idiom" written in pure vanilla JS using OOP.

After clicking 'Start Game' button, an idiom is selected at random.
The idiom is unknown to the player but a corresponding number of letters and spaces appear on the screen.
Beneath the hidden phrase, a keyboard appears. 
The player may click on the on-screen keyboard or use their own keyboard.
Each click/keypress is either a correct choice which reveals letter(s) on the screen,
or an incorrect choice which results in a lost life symbolized by a grayed-out heart.
If the player loses all five heart, the game is lost.
If the player guesses all letters in the phrase before losing all five hearts, the game is won.

Additional Features:
* Keyboard Functionality: allows players to use their physical keyboard to enter guesses
* Customized color palette, font, and edited background image from vilmosvarga: https://www.freepik.com/vectors/background"
